# Spice Circuit Solver


This project takes as input a "netlist" file (output file of an LTSpice program used to represent a circuit) which is often used in electrical engineering to represent circuits, and outputs the various circuit parameters like current, voltage etc.
The modified Nodal Analysis has been used to solve the circuits.
